# Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of building machine learning models to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset. It includes:

- Loading and preprocessing data
- Visualizing the dataset
- Training and evaluating a Linear Regression model
- Building, training, and evaluating a Neural Network model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV

By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how to implement both traditional and neural network-based regression models and compare their performance.
